## Hi, I'm Emil!

I'm a software developer, competitive programmer and investor.

In my free time I love cooking, reading, gaming, listening to music and studying the economy. I am always learning new things and striving to become the best version of myself.

I am currently working as a developer at Nerds & Company in the Netherlands.
