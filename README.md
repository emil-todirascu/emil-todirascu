### Hi, I'm Emil
I'm currently studying Business & IT at the University of Twente in the Netherlands; actively on the lookout for a role in software engineering.

I also work on some side projects which you can find in my repos.

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://emiltodirascu.com/).
